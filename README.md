# Udacity's Natural Language Processing Nanodegree

The projects completed in this program helps in developing the skills needed to start applying natural language processing techniques to real-world challenges and applications. In this program I have:

* learnt text processing fundamentals, including stemming and lemmatization 
* explored machine learning methods in sentiment analysis 
* built a speech tagging model
* learnt advanced techniques like word embeddings, deep learning attention, and more 
* build a machine translation model using recurrent neural network architectures
* learn voice user interface techniques that turn speech into text and vice versa
* built a speech recognition model using deep neural networks
